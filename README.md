A Jekyll theme for a single-page researcher profile. Includes light/dark modes, a large hero with a square profile picture, pastel palette with a fluorescent accent, social links and short bio, and a ready-to-publish demo in the `docs/` folder for GitHub Pages.

Usage: either use as a remote_theme (add `remote_theme: giovannizappella/jekyll-research-theme` to your site's `_config.yml`) or copy the theme files into your site. To publish the demo: go to the repository Settings → Pages, set Source to `main` branch `/docs` folder, and save. The site will be available at `https://giovannizappella.github.io/jekyll-research-theme`.
